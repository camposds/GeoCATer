about=Provide a brief description of the plugin and its purpose.GeoCATer is a QGIS plugin developed to facilitate geospatial conservation assessments, specifically designed for conservationists, ecologists, and GIS professionals. It provides an efficient way to calculate two key metrics for biodiversity assessments in line with the guidelines of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN): Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO). The plugin allows users to import species occurrence data from CSV files and automatically calculates EOO using the Convex Hull method, as well as AOO by generating a customizable grid. Key features include: Easy CSV import for species occurrence data, including coordinates and scientific names. Automatic calculation of EOO with visualization of the generated polygon. AOO calculation using a customizable grid (default size: 2x2 km), displaying occupied grid cells. Export of results (EOO and AOO polygons) in standard GIS formats like shapefiles. User-friendly interface with direct integration into the QGIS environment. Requirements: QGIS version 3.10 or higher. Python 3.x. This plugin aims to streamline the workflow for professionals conducting conservation assessments, offering a quick and straightforward approach to generating essential biodiversity metrics directly within QGIS.
